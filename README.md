# Spelling-Checker
It's a small python program which is used to detect and correct the spelling mistakes based on the given “corpus.txt” file. 
The program would generate a word frequency list based on the words found within the text. To correct the wrong spelling in the most common 4 mistakes which are “Deletion”, “Replacement”, “Transposition” and “Insertion”, we would estimate the most possible result with the word frequency and copy the output result to an output text file. The input text file could be edited as you wish. 
You need to check the output .txt file for result after the program is run. 
The small program is simple and straightforward to use.The correct rate of program should be over 94 percent as we tested!
